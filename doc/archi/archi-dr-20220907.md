## 1. problem:    markdown image links with relative path in stories are broken

solution:

    replace the relative URL of the images being rendered client-side HTML with the image routing path
    ![img](./csv.png)
    ![img](http://localhost/images/context_path/trace_path/csv.png)

costs:

    - frontend change: runtime replace local image path with absolute path before rendering html.
    - backend change: give client the URL to local file.
    - backend change: implement images endpoint routing the URL to local file.
    - computational: acceptable runtime overhead of substitution.


alternative:

    introduce a backend filter that redirects all *.png *.jpg to /imagerepo/route.

blocked:

    feature: resulting markdown it is not kprime indipendent.

## 2. problem: to decide the pattern for log of services called by commands and controllers.

solution:

    every service invocation from a controller has to be called by a command.
    e.g. ActorController
    
gains:

    - undo service.
    - log service.

costs:

    - refactor all controllers.
    - add all commands.
    - complete all commands.

alternative:

    every service invocation could have done directly from the controller.

## 3. problem: how to organize source code in domain package as it is becoming too big.

solution:

    package by entity: entities, values, services, repositories

gain:

    - screaming domain architecture.

doubts:

    - are there enough files to justify a package, or most are single class package?

alternative:

    package by class pattern *Service, *Repoaitory.

gains:

    - easier to add ach unit tests.
