# [KPrime Help](index.html) : Methodology

We will propose our methodology following the phases and steps described in the papaer:

from A Pay-as-you-go Methodology to Design and Build Enterprise Knowledge Graphs from Relational Databases

by Juan F. Sequeda, Willard J. Briggs, Daniel P. Miranker, and Wayne P. Heideman

Methodology phases and steps:

    1. Phase 1: Knowledge Capture
    1.1 Step 1: Analyze
    1.2 Step 2: Collect
    1.3 Step 3: Develop Knowledge Report

    2. Phase 2: Knowledge Enrichment
    2.1 Step 4: Create/Extend Ontology
    2.2 Step 5: Implement Mapping
    2.3 Step 6: Extract Queries
    2.4 Step 7: Validate with Data

    3. Phase 3: Publish

## Phase 1: Knowledge Capture

When a business question needs to be answered, we first need to understand the larger context: what is the business problem that needs to be addressed? Is it currently being addressed, and if so, how?

---
### Step 1: Analyze Processes

Answering the following questions help achieve this goal:

What: What are the business questions? What is the business problem?
Why: Why do we need to answer these questions? What is the motivation?

* goals: add-actor
* goals: add-todo
* experts: add-expert istar

* [IStar](istar.html)
* [DDD Strategic](ddd.html)
* [EventStorm](eventstorm.html)

---
### Step 2: Collect Documentation
Answering the following questions :
Who: Who produces the data? Who will consume the data? Who is involved?
How: How is this the business question answered today, if at all?
Where: Where are the data sources required to answer the business questions?
When: When will the data be consumed? Real-time? Daily? Update criteria?

* stories: add-story
---
### Step 3: Develop Knowledge Report
Starts working with the Business User to understand the business
questions, recognize key concepts and relationships from the business questions, identify the business terminology.
Detailing the CARs (Concepts, Attributes
and Relationships), with the corresponding SQL logic which serve as the mapping to the relational database

* terms: add-terms
* stories: add-story
* experts: add-expert wikipedia

---
## Phase 2: Knowledge Implementation
Ease the transformation into a formal ontology language.
---
### Step 4: Create/Extend Ontology

* terms: add-terms
* terms: add-fact
* terms: add-vocabulary

* transformers: add-transformer
* experts: add-expert transform
* experts: add-expert gufo

* [ER](er.html)
* [gUFO](gufo.html)
* [data models](models.html)
* [transformation](transformations.html)

---

### Step 5: Implement Mapping
create an R2RML mapping

* terms: add-source
* terms: add-table
* terms: add-mappings
* experts: add-expert orm

* [ORM](orm.html)
* data storage security privacy

---

### Step 6: Extract Queries
Recall that an Extract is the definition of the tabular result that a Business User would like to access.

* traces: extract-queries

* [normalization](normalization.html)
* [normalization examples](normalization_eg.html)

---

### Step 7: Validate Data

* terms: select
* experts: add-expert ltn
* experts: add-expert refine

* [missing](missing_null.html)
* [vague](vague_fuzzy.html)

---

### Step 8: Validate Model

* VUCA dimensions
* goals todo chart
* goals changeset chart
* goals gantt

* [VUCA](vuca.html)

---

## Phase 3: Publish

* as static site
* as PDF document
* as live site with hot data and schema from queries
* access authorizations
* log consumes
