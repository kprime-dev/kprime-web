# Denormalization

Dimensional models use a process called denormalization, where you include redundant copies of the data in multiple tables.
This reduces the number of tables. When you query the database, it does not need to join as many tables together, so querying is much faster.
Less joining also reduces complexity for end-users creating reports.
However, it means that the redundant copies of data must be kept in sync to ensure integrity, and that requires careful maintenance.
The redundant data also uses more storage, which may increase costs slightly.


Dimensional models use facts and dimensions:

## Facts

Facts, in this context, are pieces of data, typically numeric values, used to measure something, such as sales, orders, or revenue.
Facts can be aggregated or summarized for performance reasons, such as calculating averages or counting records,
so that these values are already calculated and don’t have to be calculated as part of running the query.

## Dimensions

Dimensions describe data’s characteristics, such as time, product, customer, or location.
They are typically represented as hierarchies, with each level of the hierarchy providing a more detailed description of the data.

Another way to understand it is that fact tables contain metrics, while dimension tables contain attributes of the metrics in the fact tables.


Instead of the natural keys used in relational modeling, dimensional modeling uses surrogate keys:
artificial values created specifically (and usually automatically) to serve as the primary key for a table.


## Tracking Changes

To track changes made to a table in dimensional modeling, you’ll use slowly changing dimensions (SCDs), of which there are three types:

**Type 1**

Type 1 SCDs overwrite existing data with the new data and discard the old data.
This is the simplest and most common type of SCD, and it is often used when the changes to the data
are not significant or when the old data is no longer needed, such as when correcting a customer’s phone number.

**Type 2**

Type 2 SCDs maintain multiple versions of the data: the new data and a record of the old data.
Use this type of SCD when you need to track the changes to the data over time and maintain a record of the old data.
For example, let’s say that six months ago, a company analyzed its sales data and found New York to be its top-selling state.
Now, if some customers have since moved out of New York to New Jersey,
rerunning the same report without accounting for these changes would show inaccurately lower sales figures for New York.
This would lead to a mistaken perception of historical data showing declining sales in New York,
which could influence strategic decisions.
So, if a customer moves from one US state to another, the company’s Type 2 SCD would store both the old state and the new one.

**Type 3**

Type 3 SCDs create a new record for each change, so you can maintain a complete history of the data.
This type of SCD is the most complex but also the most flexible.
For example, with a customer who moves from one US state to another, a Type 3 SCD would store the entire old record
and an entire new record, which could include dozens of fields, and not just the US state field.

One key difference between history tables and SCDs is their level of detail.
History tables track changes to the data at the level of individual records, while SCDs track changes at the dimension level.
And while history tables are typically used to track changes to any type of data,
SCDs are specifically for tracking changes to dimension tables in a dimensional model.
