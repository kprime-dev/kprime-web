## Sakila Context

Sakila is a small firm, with fifteen emploies. It's business is on CD, DVD rentals.
It has three branches. One centralized computer system for inventary and income control.

Unfortunately the market of CD and DVD rental has shrinken and they have decided to restart, and
renew the core business model to allign with the current market needs.

* They will partner with an online movie rental service.


---
### Sakila Technical Goals

* Have a new web interface for associates, not only for sakila staff.
* Cut old inventory stuff.
* Integrate partner inventory.
* Integrate a social meeting platform.
* Mantain the current view from branches.

[Technical Goals](http://51.77.141.5:7000/todos.html)

---
### Sakila Sources
* Current monolith DB to evolve. (PostgreSQL)
* New partner inventory DB to integrate. (batch CSV)

### Current Model

[Computed](http://51.77.141.5:7000/chart/sakila528574178/sakila5285_487000000_tracedb.xml)

---
### Sakila Current Core Source Usage
* CRUD movie
* CRUD customer[Mary]( http://localhost:7000/data/sakila/sakila1588406044610/sakila1588406044610_db.xml/customer?first_name='MARY' )
* CRUD buy/rental
* Compute income per branch
* Compute gross and net income

---
### Sakila New Core Source Usage
* CRUD associate : [Mary](http://localhost:7000/ldata/sakila/sakila1588406044610/sakila1588406044610_db.xml/customer?first_name='MARY' )
* CRUD meeting : [Event.rdf](https://schema.org/Event) [story]
* Compute income per branch [story]
* Compute gross and net income [story]

---
### Current Query: total income

    SELECT payment_date, amount, sum(amount) OVER (ORDER BY payment_date)
    FROM (
      SELECT CAST(payment_date AS DATE) AS payment_date, SUM(amount) AS amount
      FROM payment
      GROUP BY CAST(payment_date AS DATE)
    ) p
    ORDER BY payment_date;

[Computed](http://localhost:7000/traceplay/sakila528574178/Story_q1.md)

---
### Current VUCA
* Volatility, zero changes, stable since years.
* Uncertaninty, low, almost zero, old terminology is in use since years.
* Complexity, adeguate for a small business.
* Ambiguity, medium, the old conceptual model is lost, but the DB is alligned in bussness terminology and query. Tables are normalized in good shape.

---
### Iteration 1
* Buss Query1: Inventory switch.
    * Search once a day per customer.
    * Load batch once a day.
* Current infrastructure could support this.

---
### First Model

---
### Iteration 1 Activities
* Definition of terms.
* Normalization.
* Add functional dependency and other constraints.
* Data integration.
* Data clean up.
* Allign to new terminology and queries.

---
### First VUCA
* Volatility, a lot of changes.
* Uncertaninty, a lot attributes and definitions are empty.
* Complexity, delegatin inventory complexity is reduced.
* Ambiguity, a lot, the old conceptual model is lost.
